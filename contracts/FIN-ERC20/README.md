# FIN ERC20 Mintable token contract

This is the official Finterra ERC20 contract. This token is a controlled mintable token which will only mint a total number of tokens equal to the aggregate amount of FIN migration records as result of the migration of FIN points. 

FIN ERC20 tokens are only minted as they are claimed. Claiming references the records held within the Finterra deployed FINMigrate.sol contract for the total amount claimable per registered address.
