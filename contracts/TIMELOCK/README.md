# Token Lock Contract

A portion of the Finterra allocation of tokens is required to be time locked to ensure that the company and partners cannot exit early.

This contract uses the approve/transferFrom funtionality of the FIN ERC20 to allow anyone (but especially the company) to lock tokens for a period of time.
