# FIN point to FIN ERC20 Migration Contract

This contract is built to migrate existing FIN point balances to FIN ERC20 tokens balances on the Ethereum network.

All of the FIN amounts recorded here do not represent actual FIN tokens but instead are meant to be stored as a reference record for later claiming after a full audit has been run to ensure balance accuracy.

As FIN points are virtual points currently held on Finterra's centralized architecture, any of the record production or manipulation that occurs in this contract must originate from a Finterra controlled address.
