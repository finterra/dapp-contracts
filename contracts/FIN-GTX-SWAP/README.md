# FIN to GTX Swap Contract

This contract is intended to allow exsisting FIN point holders to swap thier FIN points for claimable GALLACTIC network tokens once they are available.

All of the GTX amounts recorded here do not represent actual GTX tokens but instead are meant to be stored as a reference record until after the GALLACTIC crowdsale period. After the GALLACTIC crowdsale, there will be a GTX claiming period. During this time, any registered address which had opted to swap FIN points for GTX will be able to claim an amount of GTX equal to the record stored here in addition to any GTX claimable from the crowdsale itself.

As FIN points are virtual points currently held on Finterra's centralized architecture, any of the record production or manipulation that occurs in this contract must originate from a Finterra controlled address.

This swap record contract is meant to facilitate the Finterra Founder's Initiative, allowing early participants of Finterra's services to enter the GALLACTIC ecosystem. This initiative is being run to allow fair participation in the new GALLACTIC technology as GALLACTIC transitions to an independant foundation.
