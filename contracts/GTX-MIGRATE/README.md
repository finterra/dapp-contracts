# GTX ERC20 Migration Contract (Post-ICO)

This contract is built to store GTX ERC-20 Tokens as records for migration on the Ethereum Network post the Gallactic ICO

All of the GTX amounts recorded here do not represent actual GTX tokens but instead are meant to be 
stored as a reference record for later claiming after a full audit has been run to ensure balance accuracy.

As GTX ERC-20 Tokens are GTX Tokens on the Ethereum Network and are not the actual GTX Network Token.

The GTX Network Tokens will be generated for each user after the MAINNET Launch 
as per the reference records present on this contract.
