# GTX ERC-20 Token Contract (Gallactic ICO)

This contract is built to issue, transfer and store GTX ERC-20 Tokens 
on the Ethereum Network to be distributed after the Gallactic ICO

The GTX ERC-20 Tokens will eventually be migrated 
from the Ethereum Network to the Gallactic Network
and issued as GTX Network Tokens.

The GTX ERC-20 Tokens are NOT the GTX Network Tokens.
